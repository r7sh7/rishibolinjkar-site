            <h1>Hi! I am Hrishikesh Bolinjkar</h1>
            <p>I am a Computer Science student at Fergusson College Pune. Science fiction movies and Iron Man in particular, inspired me to pursue a career in Computer Science. I love keeping up with latest trends in technology and also building solutions by leveraging it. Apart from coding I am football enthusiast and love playing as well as watching football. My interest in football and tech gave rise to the idea of a Turf Booking App for easy booking as well as management of turf bookings in my city. This encouraged me to pursue a career in web development</p>
